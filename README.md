## Foundational DevOps Concepts

### What is DevOps
   
DevOps is a combination of principles, practices that aims to streamline **Sofware development(Dev)** and **IT operations(Ops)**. The goal of DevOps is to deliver software applications faster with continuous improvements. Simply put, DevOps is a process of improving software delivery while ensuring automation, proper quality, continous monitoring and testing.

### The core DevOps Principles

DevOps principles are practices that streamline development and operations so that software can be delivered efficiently. Some of the core principles of DevOps are listed and briefly explaind below:

* **Automation**: The process of automating tasks like testing and deployment reduces human intervention and minimizes error.
* **Continuous integration and continous delivery**: This process involves integrating code frequently, automating the deployment of applications to production
* **Monitoring**: This involves tracking key metrics to identify problems in systems and where improvements are needed.
* **Shared responsibility**: Development and Operations team need to share the responsibility of the software lifecycle as a unit, rather than a stand-alone process.
* **Customer Focus**: The need of users or customers must be a priority. Feedback must be taken seriously so as to ensure products are user-centric.

## DevOps Lifecycle Stages

Some of the various DevOps lifecycle stages are discussed briefly below:

* **Planning**: This is  the phase where project goals, requirements are defined. This helps to ensure there is synergy between the developement and operation teams.
* **Development**: This phase is bascially where the code is written, created and managed. Also code quality is ensured in this stage.
* **Building**: The building phase is the stage where the already written code compiled, packaged into deployable artifacts. The code is eventually prepared for release and deployment afterwards.
* **Testing**: Unlike the stages discussed earlier, the testing phase is continuous-the process spans through the entire software development lifecylce i.e development to deployment. It is an automated process i.e whenever code is pushed, tests are ran to verify it and to ensure such code is free of bugs.
* **Release**: This phase is where tested and approved software builds are moved towards production. This stage marks the beginning of the "Ops" part of the DevOps process.
* **Deployment**: This stage is where the already approved software are released to production thereby making it accessible to the end users.
* **Operations**: Right after the software has been deployed, the operation phase is to ensure the reliablity, performance, and stability of the application. This phase can also be called the post-deployment phase.
* **Monitoring**: This phase involves tracking and measuring key metrics to identify issues or problems early, improve performance and while enhancing the experience of the users. With monitoring, problems are detected and solved before it leads to the software breaking or crashing.
